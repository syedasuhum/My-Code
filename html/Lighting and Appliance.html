                        <p>Smart lighting is the most important innovation in lighting since the invention of the lightbulb. It adds so much functionality to such a key part of our lives, 
                            elevating the concept of lighting our homes beyond just the utilitarian.<br><br>
                            A lighting control system is an intelligent network based lighting control solution that incorporates communication between various system 
                            inputs and outputs related to lighting control with the use of one or more central computing devices.<br><br>
                            Lighting control systems may include a lighting technology designed for energy efficiency, convenience and security. This may include high efficiency fixtures
                             and automated controls that make adjustments based on conditions such as occupancy or daylight availability. </p>

                    <p>A smart switch is a programmable wireless switch that provides the same functionality as a traditional switch while allowing lighting control and automation. Smart switches connect to a smart home hub
                         and allow users to control their lights using a mobile app, voice assistant, or an automated schedule.<br><br>
                        A wireless light switch is a light switch that commands a light
                         or home appliance to turn itself off or on, instead of interrupting the power line going to the light fixture. <br><br>
                         Smart Switches for home automation thatare a work of passion, art & imagination. These switches not just brighten up the dull boring look of the electrical consoles but also offer a wide range of functions.
                         Fully functional with a feather touch response, the smart switches control your lights, fans, ACs, curtains, doorbell, Wi-Fi and any other connected devices with ease, perfection, and style.<br><br>

                        <p>Alexa is capable of voice interaction, music playback, making to-do lists, setting alarms, streaming podcasts, playing audiobooks, and providing weather, traffic, and other real-time information.<br><br> Alexa can also control several smart devices using itself as a home automation hub.
                         We will use on this project, the “Echo Dot”, which allows users to activate the device using a wake-word, such as “Alexa” or “Computer”, as in “Star Trek!.<br><br> 
                         In the home automation space, Alexa can interact with several different devices like Philips Hue, Belkin Wemo, Sonoff, etc.
                         Home Assistant is a rather advanced way of automating your home. Luckily, there is a much easier way to do home automation using the Alexa app. The advantage is that you don’t need to set up any smart home automation software or server.

                <p>Automated blinds (or smart blinds) are window treatments that are operated by a motor situated within the roller mechanism.
                     The motors can be wired, battery or solar powered, and the blinds can be adjusted by switch or remote control.<br><br>
                     Curtain Controller' module is a retrofit home automation device that can automate almost all type of motorized curtains, shades, blinds and Windows. The curtains can be operated by OOB Smart application, IR Remotes, or voice control through Alexa or Google and as well as Physical/Touch Switches.<br><br>
                     Smart Curtain comes with 6 features; Remote Control, Voice Command, Schedule Open/Close, Smart Home Automation, Pull Motion & Mobile Control.

                            As the user gives commands to the Google assistant, Home appliances like Bulb, Fan and Motor etc., can be controlled accordingly.

                <p>A door or window sensor is typically a two-piece magnetic contact sensor. When the system is armed and a door or 
                    window is opened, the two magnetic sensors are separated from each other, thereby tripping the alarm.<br><br>
                    Automatic door opens when the door controller receives an activation signal by the sensor and activate the gear motor to drive the belt and pulley.
                     When no one is detected inside the activation area, the door starts closing after a designated period of time.<br><br>
                     When a door or window opens, the sensor's magnetic field breaks. This break flips a switch in the sensor. The sensor transmits this information to the alarm panel, which then alerts you.
                      This type of magnetically operated sensor is known as a reed switch.<br>
                      When no one is detected inside the activation area,
                       the door starts closing after a designated period of time.
