                            <p> It comprises PLCs and PIDs. You have got the data from a sensor and you now want to control a motor according to it.
                                For that, a program needs to be written in a controller that will accept the hardware sensor input and control the hardware motor output accordingly.
                                A PID small controller which will modulate the output according to the input received, based on PID calculations.

                                This is done by SCADA. Visualize the whole process, see alarms, generate reports, run batches, and control the operator’s action through the audit trail.

                                there are multiple processes in a plant and it is required to supervise the entire manufacturing process from start to end.
